The Keem/Reisdorf side:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [76]) }}">Martin & Catherine Keem</a> (5 generations back) were both born in
                <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace" target="_blank">Alsace</a>
                    <img src="/flags/alsace.gif" />
                    (Gunstett and Schaenenburg, respectively)</b>, and
                they were married and came to the US together <b>around 1830</b>. They had a son named
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [51]) }}">Nicholas</a>. </li>

            <li>Mary Glaser came to this country from <b>Germany</b>  <img src="/flags/de.gif" />
                with
                <a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [80]) }}">her parents</a> and widowed grandmother
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [697]) }}">Gertrude Simon Glaser</a> in
                <b>1838</b>, at the age of 8.
                Around the age of 17, she married
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [250]) }}">Peter Reisdorf</a>, who was born in <b>Rheinland, Prussia</b>
                <img src="/flags/prussia.gif" /> and came to the states sometime <b>between 1824 and 1845</b>.

                Mary & Peter Reisdorf (5 generations back)
                had a daughter named <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [50]) }}">Catherine Reisdorf.</a>

                <p>A little more history:
            In the 1860's, three of Mary's younger brothers <a href="http://family.app/stories/797">fought in the civil war</a>, click around
                    in <a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [80]) }}">that family's pages</a> for some interesting history
                    (see book icons).  Also, we've traced back on Mary's side to
                    a set of her paternal great great great grandparents:
                    <a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [218]) }}">Mathias & Maria  Zohler</a>,
                    in Germany in the <b>1600's</b>. </p>
                    <p>Mary Glaser's family may also have been in the US generations beforehand. Her great-great grandmother was Maria Kuhn,
                and based on other matching trees on ancestry.com, Maria's parents, grandparents, and all 4 sets of great-grandparents had come to the
                US together in the early 1700's. They stayed for 3 generations but Maria Kuhn was born in Germany (though her parents lived
                        and died in the US)- this data needs to be verified. </p>
                <p>We have records for Martin Keem's ancestors in
                    <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunstett" target="_blank">Gunstett</a></b>
