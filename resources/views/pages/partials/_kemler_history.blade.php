    Gert Kemler's family: </h4>

The Kemler side:
        <ul>
            <li>Gert's father <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [18]) }}">Louis Kemler</a> (3 generations back) came to the US
                from <b>Kiev, Ukraine</b> (still part of the Russian empire at the time) with his father
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [17]) }}">Solomon</a> <b>around 1902</b>- he was
                13 years old. They left Russia together, Solomon left Louis in England for about 2 years (living in a small room in
                the back of a bakery), and Solomon came to NYC by himself to earn money to bring his family to America.
                <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [16]) }}">Ida</a>  stayed in Russia <img src="/flags/ru.gif" />
                with at least one other child (most likely both Rose and Joseph) until Solomon could send for them.
                Louis left England from Liverpool and came to NYC as a stowaway on a ship, and the others joined within a few years, sometime
                between 1904 and 1908
                (Charlie was born in Russia around 1904, and Molly was born in Massachusetts in 1908).

            </li>


        </ul>


The Kaplan side:
        <ul><li>Bessie's parents <a href="{{ action('FamilyController@show', [3]) }}">Ida & Barnett Kaplan</a> (four generations back)
                were  the generation that came here (from <b>Lithuania</b> <img src="/flags/lt.gif" />) .
                They started in NYC (where Bessie was born in August of 1888), and it looks like they had  moved to Massachusetts by
                1889 when her brother Harry was born (based on 1900 US census).
                We know about children for four of Ida & Barnett's children:


                <ul>
                    <li><a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [15]) }}">Bessie</a>'s descendants include the Kemlers and the Kaplans (through her daughter Gert's marriage, different Kaplans than Ida and Barnett).  </li>
                    <li><a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [1]) }}">Gertrude</a>'s descendants are the Franks and the Zorns.    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [13]) }}">Hymie</a>'s descendants are the Goodmans.  </li>
                    <li><a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [14]) }}">Etta</a>'s descendants are the Nitkins, the Tennens, and the Klapmans.  </li>
                 </ul>

            </li></ul>

<a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [15]) }}">Bessie</a>
married <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [18]) }}">Louis</a> and
together they had <a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [26]) }}">Irving</a>,
<a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [27]) }}">Gert</a>,
<a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [25]) }}">Matthew</a>,
<a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [24]) }}">Norman</a>, and
<a href="{{ action('PeopleController@show', [23]) }}">Stanley</a>.
